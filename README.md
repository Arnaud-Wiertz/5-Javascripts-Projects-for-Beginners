# 5-Javascripts-Projects-for-Beginners

## Description:

This repository contains some vanilla JavaScript projects taken from a YouTube challenge.

In all cases, the goal was to build something that worked while respecting the given specifications. The style was not a priority. What mattered was to build something that worked on your own. Googling was authorized but the goal was not to simply copy/paste existing projects.
