# 5-Javascripts-Projects-for-Beginners

## Description:

This repository contains some vanilla JavaScript projects taken from a YouTube challenge.

In all cases, the goal is to build something that works while respecting the given specifications. The style is not a priority. While googling is authorized, doing a copy/paste of an existing project isn't.
